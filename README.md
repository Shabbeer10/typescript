## **What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types, making it easier to catch errors early and write robust code.

## **Why Learn TypeScript?**

- **Static Typing:** Improves code reliability and maintainability.
- **Better Tooling:** TypeScript provides intelligent code completion, navigation, and refactoring.
- **Popular in Industry:** Widely used in modern web development, especially in frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.
- **Enhances JavaScript Skills:** Helps deepen your understanding of JavaScript while adding advanced features.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- Basic knowledge of **JavaScript**.
- Familiarity with **ES6+ syntax** (e.g., arrow functions, modules, and destructuring).
- A working development environment with **Node.js** and a package manager like npm or Yarn.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. **Install TypeScript Compiler:**

```bash
   npm install -g typescript
```

2. **Verify Installation:**

```bash
tsc --version
